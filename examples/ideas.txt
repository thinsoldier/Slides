#thn-css-sized
How to set the slidehow width and height via css/media queries instead of hard coding in settings at instantiation.

All slides have equal sized images with absolutely positioned div of text covering right 33% of image.
Media query css to move the text box under the image as display:block;
BRL or Graham's details-slideshow.js code.
	The sjs.manualUpdate which is something I added can be replaced with standard sjs.update probably.
	Need the window.matchMedia stuff
	and mql.addListener( orientationChangeHandler );
	and setTimeout stuff inside of orientationChangeHandler
	and do not need anything related to centerImage.
	Do not need slidetweaks.
	So, the relevant parts of uponOrientation() can maybe go directly into the setTimeout section of the code.
